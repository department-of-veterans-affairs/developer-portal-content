We have added access control to the Direct Deposit Management API to block dependent access to deposit accounts. This additional account security ensures that only Veterans can manage direct deposit details.

* The Veteran identifier in the API request is checked against VA records to determine Veteran or Dependent status.

* If the identifier is for a non-Veteran or Dependent, an error message is returned in the API response and access to the deposit account is denied.
