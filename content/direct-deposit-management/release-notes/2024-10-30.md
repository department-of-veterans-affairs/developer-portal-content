We've updated the access control for consumers of the Direct Deposit Management API. In this release, a new restriction has been introduced to block dependents from accessing or modifying direct deposit information. 

* *Access Control:* Dependents who attempt to access Direct Deposit Management API will now be blocked.
* *Error Messaging:* When a dependent tries to access DDM, they will recieve the following error message:
"End-user is not a Veteran and cannot access direct deposit information"

This enhancement ensures that only those classified as Veterans can manage direct deposit details, adding an extra layer of securrity for account updates and information management.
