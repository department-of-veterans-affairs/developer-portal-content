We have added additional logging for potential fraud alerts from our backend system. When the response we receive contains a fraud alert flag, our API logs the potential fraud alert; access is not blocked. Our API then sends an alert as an HTTP response with Fraud Alert Flag = True to our downstream service. This new functionality will allow our backend system to provide the calling front-end system with an alert so that any changes or research actions can be taken for that account.
