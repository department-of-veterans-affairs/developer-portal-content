For security and fraud prevention, the front-end consumer must obtain successful two-factor authentication (2FA) of the user before submitting a Direct Deposit API request.

Once the API receives an API request, it uses the Integrated Control Number (ICN) provided to confirm:
1. if the requestor is a Veteran, and
2. if they are eligible to receive VA payments for disability, pension, or education benefits.

If confirmed, the API grants access to deposit account information. Dependents are not currently granted access to direct deposit information.  

if an account is flagged by the VA source system for prior potential fraud activity, the API adds a HTTP header alert to the API response generated for account additions and updates.
