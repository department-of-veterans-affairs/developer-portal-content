The Direct Deposit Management API now enforces stricter validation and fraud detection measures.

The Direct Deposit API checks the ID of the requester to determine if they are a Veteran or dependent. If they are a dependent, or if Veteran/dependent status cannot be determined, the API generates a HTTP 422 error to notify the requester that they are not allowed to make updates.  

When a Veteran submits updates to their direct deposit account, the API detects whether the account is flagged by the VA source system for prior possible fraud activity. A frauld alert entry is added to the header of the API response in this case.
