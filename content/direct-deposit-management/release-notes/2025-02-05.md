The Direct Deposit Management API now enforces stricter validation and fraud detection measures.

- Dependents can no longer update direct deposit information to prevent data conflicts with downstream systems.
- The API checks the requester's ID to determine if they are a Veteran or dependent. If the requester is a dependent or their status is unclear, the API returns an HTTP 422 error notifying the requester that they aren't allowed to make updates.
- If a Veteranâ€™s account is flagged for potential fraud by the VA source system, the API response includes a fraud alert in the header.
