Dependents are no longer allowed to make updates to direct deposit information. This change is implemented to prevent potential data conflicts with downstream systems.

The Direct Deposit API checks the ID of the requester to determine if they are a Veteran or dependent. If they are a dependent, or if Veteran/dependent status cannot be determined, the API generates a HTTP 422 error to notify the requester that they are not allowed to make updates.  

When a Veteran submits updates to their direct deposit account, the API detects whether the account is flagged by the VA source system for prior possible fraud activity. A frauld alert entry is added to the header of the API response in this case.
