We added an alert notification for direct deposit accounts flagged for “potential” fraud. When a backend VA data source has an account flagged for potential fraud activity, the API includes an HTTP 422 alert message and information in the response header.

The API doesn't block access to deposit accounts that have been flagged for fraud. Instead, it sends HTTP alerts when access attempts occur, allowing the API consumer to decide whether to block access or monitor activity.
