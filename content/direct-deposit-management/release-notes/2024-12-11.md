We added an alert notification for direct deposit accounts flagged for “potential” fraud. When a backend VA data source has an account flagged for potential fraud activity, the API includes an HTTP 422 alert message and information in the response header.

Access to deposit accounts flagged for fraud is not blocked by the API; rather, the HTTP alert messaging notifies when access attempts occur for flagged accounts. This puts control for blocking account access or monitoring activity with the API consumer.
