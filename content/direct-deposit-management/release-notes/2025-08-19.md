We corrected an issue where the API returned an HTTP 502 when a Veteran's profile was missing their address. The API now returns an HTTP 422 error (Unable to update) with the message Address not found.
Additionally we switched to a more efficient backend service for Veteran address validation. This service no longer fails when non-essential profile values (e.g., date of birth) are missing.
