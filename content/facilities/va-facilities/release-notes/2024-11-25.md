We added four new facility operating status codes:
- TEMPORARY_CLOSURE, when a facility is temporarily closed
- TEMPORARY_LOCATION, when a facility is temporarily operating from a location
- VIRTUAL_CARE, when a facility only offers telehealth options
- COMING_SOON, when facility is not yet opened, but is planned for the near future
