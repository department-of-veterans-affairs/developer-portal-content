You can now see if Health facilities are mobile or temporarily deactivated.
- Added `mobile` and `active_status` flags to the API response for Health facilities (other facility types will return `null` for these fields). Options for `mobile` are `true` or `false`; options for `active_status` are `A` for Active or `T` for Temporarily deactivated.
  - Mobile facilities are subject to frequent address changes. To get the exact current location, please call the number listed.
