We've added four new supplemental status codes to the `operating_status` field in the /facilities endpoints. These statuses only apply to cemetery records. This reflects the cemeteries capacity to provide for new burials. 

- `BURIALS_OPEN`, Burial space is available
- `BURIALS_CLOSED`, Call for burial status
- `BURIALS_CREMATION_ONLY`, Cremation interments only
- `BURIALS_UNDER_CONSTRUCTION`, Cemetery is under construction
