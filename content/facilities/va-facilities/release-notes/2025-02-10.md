We've added four new supplemental status codes to the `operating_status` field in the /facilities endpoints. These statuses only apply to cemetery records. This reflects the cemeteries capacity to provide for new burials. 

- `BURIALS_OPEN`: This indicates burial space is available.
- `BURIALS_CLOSED`: This indicates the status is not available and the facility should be contacted directly.
- `BURIALS_CREMATION_ONLY`: This indicates only cremation interments are available. 
- `BURIALS_UNDER_CONSTRUCTION`: This indicates a cemetery is under construction.
