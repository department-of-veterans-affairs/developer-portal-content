The VA Facilities API version v1 has launched. Updates include:
- Full integration of health services data with 100+ available health services. The longer list also includes more robust data, such as where, when, and how to access the health services.
- Changes made for better API responses and functionality, such as:
  - New parent facility details.
  - Cleaner and more concise data presentation by omitting nulls and empty fields from the API results.
  - Requests to the /facilities endpoint now have a maximum page size of 1000 records per request. Additional results for large queries can be obtained through the built-in paging controls.
  - New service-specific data from the addition of two new service endpoints:
    - Bulk service endpoint /facilities/{facilityId}/services/{serviceId} to retrieve all services and their details associated with a facility.
    - Single service endpoint /facilities/{facilityId}/services to return details for a single service by request.
  
  - Expanded search terms allow for greater flexibility in filtering results. For example, it is now possible to run a query showing all the health facilities without including more limiting parameters.
  
- Modified schema changes for the following fields:
  - opertionalHoursSpecialInstructions
  - service
  - detailed_services
  - waitTime
- Consolidation of tools by: 
  - Removing the /nearby facility lookup by address feature while maintaining the more accurate lookup by lat/long feature.
  - Removing the special case /all endpoint. You can now obtain all facility records by simply providing an empty search to the /facilities endpoint.
