The Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) identifier for each health facility is now available.
- `visn` has been added to all `/facilities` endpoints. [View code change(s)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/pull/3609)
- For non-health facilities, this will return as `null`.
