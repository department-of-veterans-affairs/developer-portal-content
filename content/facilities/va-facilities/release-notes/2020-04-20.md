You can now see Health facilities' operating status and any important textual notes about that facility.
- Added `operating_status` and `additional_info` flags to the API response for Health facilities (other facility types will return null for these fields). Options for operating_status are `normal, notice, limited, closed`; options for `additional_info` is a text string showing details of facility notices for visitors, such as messages about parking lot closures or floor visitation information.
- `active_status` is deprecated and replaced with `operating_status`. It will be removed in version 1.
