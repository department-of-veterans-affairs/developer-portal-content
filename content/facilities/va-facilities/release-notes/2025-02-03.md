We have added two new service types:
- `speech`: A health-type service representing Speech pathlogy. A service specific to assiting those who have difficulty speaking or understanding what other people are saying. This service was previously combined with the service `audiology`. With this split both services are now independent services.
- `veteranServiceOrganizations`: A benefits-type service representing Veteran Service Organizations (VSO). A service that connects you with someone who can file a claim, decision review, or appeal on their behalf. While benefits focused, this service can also appear at health facilities if offered.
