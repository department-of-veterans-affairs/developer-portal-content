Version 0 of the Facilities API is now deprecated. When we deprecate a version of an API, it will still be supported, but its use is discouraged and it will be deactivated at a future date. We’ll honor service-level agreements, but no new features will be added to the API version and only critical defects will be considered for correction. We’ve deprecated this API version because version 1 was launched providing enriched data with better API responses and functionality.
