We've added the new Education Benefits API to the developer portal. It replaces the EVSS Education Services API. 

Important: To get production access, you must work for VA or have specific VA agreements. If you have questions, please contact us here; https://developer.va.gov/support/contact-us.

The Education Benefits API returns information about a Veteran’s education benefits, including:

- Whether a Veteran is eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill’s education benefits.
- The total education benefits earned by the Veteran.
- The amount of a Veteran’s education benefits that has been used.
- The remaining amount of a Veteran’s education benefit.
- Details of educational enrollments for which benefits were used, including start and end dates, schools, and credits received. 

The API takes in a Veteran’s ICN and returns: 
•	Whether the Veteran is eligible for post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) benefits
•	Amount of education benefits used
•	Remaining benefits entitlement
•	Historical enrollments, including begin and end dates, type of training, facility and hours

Authentication and Authorization

This API uses the client credentials grant (CCG) flow to provide an access token to trusted systems. See our Authorization Guide for more details.

As always, it's important to know that the new version must support backward compatibility. It should:
•	Be tolerant of unknown fields in the payload.  Ignore the deserialization of new fields but do not eliminate them from the payload if needed for subsequent PUT requests. 
•	Be prepared to handle HTTP status codes not explicitly specified in endpoint definitions.
•	Follow the redirect when the server returns HTTP status code 301 (Moved Permanently).
