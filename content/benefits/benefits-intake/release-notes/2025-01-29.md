The Final Status (`final_status`) attribute has been added to the `/uploads`, `/uploads/{id}`, and `/uploads/report` endpoints of the API. This attribute indicates whether the status of a submission is final. It will default to `false` unless one of the following conditions is met:
- The submission reaches VBMS
- The submission has reached the success status but will not be uploaded into VBMS
- The submission expired
- The submission has errored, with a DOC1XX code

Submissions with a `final_status` of `true` will no longer update to a new status.
