Previously, the Benefits Intake API only checked the dimensions of the first page in a submitted PDF. This caused issues when subsequent pages exceeded size limits, leading to failed uploads with unclear error messages.

With this update, the API now checks the dimensions of all pages in a submitted PDF, ensuring better validation and clearer error messaging.
**Previous issues**:
- The API only checked the first page's dimensions.
- PDFs with oversized pages beyond the first page caused failed uploads with unclear error messages.
**New changes**
- The API now checks the dimensions of **all** pages within the PDF.
- End-users can submit PDFs with individual page dimensions up to 78" x 101".
- If any page exceeds the limit, the API returns an error: "**Maximum page size exceeded. Limit is 78 in x 101 in**."
