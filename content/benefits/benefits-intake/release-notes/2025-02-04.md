Previously, the Benefits Intake API only checked the dimensions of the first page in a submitted PDF. This caused issues when subsequent pages exceeded size limits, leading to failed uploads with unclear error messages.

With this update, the API now checks the dimensions of all pages in a submitted PDF, ensuring better validation and clearer error messaging.
Prior to this release, the Benefits Inake API was limited to checking the dimensions of the first page of each submitted PDF document.  
PDFs with over sized pages subsequent to the first page were encountering errors during the intake process resulting in a failed upload with non-specifc error detail.
This release modifies Benefits Inake API to check **all** the individual page's dimensions within the PDF and will return an error with message field set to: *"Maximum page size exceeded. Limit is 78 in x 101 in."*
