(v1) On May 17, we made changes to Veteran First and Last name field validations for the Benefits Intake API, which are described in a release note below.

Based on the high number of errors being received, we are temporarily turning off these changes and reverting back to previous field requirements. We are working on updating the new validations to allow spaces and reduce the number of errors returned.

When those changes are made, we will turn on the new validations, post an updated release note, and send a notification to all consumers.
