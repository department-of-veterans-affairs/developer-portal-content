(v1) In order to further automate matches of submitted documents with Veterans downstream, the required Veteran First and Last name metadata fields now only allow alpha characters, dashes -, and forward slashes /. Additionally, these fields must be less than or equal to 50 characters. No numbers or other special characters may be submitted in these fields.

Submissions with invalid characters will receive Error Status DOC102	"Invalid Veteran name (e.g. empty, invalid characters, or too long). Names must match the regular expression /^[a-zA-Z\-\/]{1,50}$/"
