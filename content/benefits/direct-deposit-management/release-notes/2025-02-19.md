### Access API test data directly on VA Developer

**We’ve improved the way test data can be accessed.**

As of **February 19th**, test data for VA APIs is available directly on [VA Developer](https://developer.va.gov/). Each API now has a dedicated test data page for easier and more secure consumer access.

**What’s new?**

* Each API now has an individual test data page.
* GitHub test data links and references to GitHub test data will be removed from VA Developer. 

**What’s unchanged?**

* The test data itself remains the same.
* You can still use it as before for testing and integration.
* If the API you use does not currently provide test data or requires VA agreements to access it, that remains unchanged.

To access the updated test data, visit the API you use and find the test data page through its sidebar navigation.
