We added a new API to the developer portal called the **[Direct Deposit Management API](https://developer.va.gov/explore/benefits/docs/direct-deposit-management?version=current)**.

This API replaces the EVSS Patient Payment Information Update (PPIU) service and offers many added benefits, such as:

  - Detailed error response bodies with helpful troubleshooting information for existing and new error response codes.
  - Removed routing number checks against an outdated list of fraudulent routing numbers (and all associated errors).
  - More data being cached for latency improvement purposes.

**Important Differences between the Direct Deposit Management API and the Legacy Service:**
- The API is now on `developer.va.gov`. Therefore, the URLs have changed:
  * Legacy URL: `https://www.ebenefits.va.gov:444/<servicename>/<endpointname>`
  * New URL:    `https://api.va.gov/services/<servicename>/v1/<endpointname>`
- The new API requires OAuth, so consumers will not need to pass PII. Instead, consumers will provide the ICN in each request using a query parameter. The API will pull additional Veteran details as needed.
- Responses are in JSON instead of HTML. 
- Error messages are no longer part of the common response for both endpoints. They are handled in 400, 422, or 500 responses.

As always, it is important to support backward compatibility.

Your integration should:
- Be prepared to handle HTTP status codes not explicitly specified in endpoint definitions.
- Be tolerant of unknown fields in the payload and ignore the deserialization of new fields.
- Follow the redirect when the server returns an HTTP status code 301 (Moved Permanently).

The deployed release version is 1.0.39
