We have added a new field to the API responses that reports the "Status" of the ID submitted in the API request. The field name is 'veteranStatus' and values for this field are:

* VETERAN
* DEPENDENT
* NEITHER_VETERAN_NOR_DEPENDENT
* COULD_NOT_DETERMINE_DUE_TO_EXCEPTION

Also, the HTTP 422 error when a fraud indicator is detected has been modified in 2 ways:
1. The message in the header for "fraud alert" has been removed.
2. The message detail now includes that an update could not be made due to a fraud indicator.

For more details, [review the API documentation](https://developer.va.gov/explore/api/direct-deposit-management/docs?version=current).
