The Benefits Documents API includes two new capabilities.

We added a participantId parameter that enables uploading benefits-related documents for surviving dependents. It also enables returning a list of their benefits-related document names. participantID must be used for surviving dependents and may also be used for Veterans. This addition applies to the request object in these endpoints:

* /documents
* /documents/search

We added the ability to upload forms to appoint an accredited organization (VA Form 21-22) and an accredited individual (VA Form 21-22a) as power of attorney. Note that claimId is not a required parameter for these uploads. To learn more, review the [Benefits Documents API documentation](https://developer.va.gov/explore/api/benefits-documents/docs?version=current).
