This release includes 2 new changes to the Benefits Documents API: 

We added a **participantId** parameter that enables uploading benefits-related documents for surviving dependents. It also enables returning a list of their benefits-related document names. **participantID** must be used for surviving dependents and may also be used for Veterans. This addition applies to the request object in these endpoints:

* /documents
* /documents/search
 
Additionally, the Benefits Documents API now supports the upload of POA documents (VA Forms 21-22 and 21-22a). POA uploads will differ in that the claim ID field will not be a required parameter when submitting.   

To learn more, review the [Benefits Documents API documentation](https://developer.va.gov/explore/api/benefits-documents/docs?version=current).
