This release includes 2 new changes to the Benefits Documents API: 

In order to enable dependents of deceased Veterans to upload and search for benefits related documents, we have added a new participantId parameter to the request objects for the following endpoints:
* /documents
* /documents/search 

The participantId value is used to identify veterans and/or their dependents, and will be used instead of a file number. 
 
Additionally, the Benefits Documents API now supports the upload of POA documents (VA Forms 21-22 and 21-22a). POA uploads will differ in that the claim ID field will not be a required parameter when submitting.   

To learn more, review the [Benefits Documents API documentation](https://developer.va.gov/explore/api/benefits-documents/docs?version=current).
