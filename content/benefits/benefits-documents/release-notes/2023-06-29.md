[Release Date]

We added a new API to the developer portal. This API will be replacing the EVSS Documents Service API. It allows consumers to submit supporting claim documentation to the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS) eFolder or retrieve a list of supporting documents in a Veteran's VBMS eFolder. This release includes the following endpoints: 

-   /documents
-   /documents/search

Important Differences between the Benefits Documents API and the Legacy Service:

The API is now on developer.va.gov. Therefore, the URLs have changed:
Legacy URL: https://www.ebenefits.va.gov:444/<servicename>/<endpointname>
New URL: https://api.va.gov/services/<servicename>/v1/<endpointname>
The new API requires OAuth, so consumers will not need to pass PII. Instead, consumers will provide the file number in each request as a parameter. The API will pull additional Veteran details as needed.
Error messages are no longer part of the common response for both endpoints. They are handled in 400, 422, or 500 responses.

As always, it is important to support backward compatibility.

Your integration should:

Be prepared to handle HTTP status codes not explicitly specified in endpoint definitions.
Be tolerant of unknown fields in the payload and ignore the deserialization of new fields.
Follow the redirect when the server returns an HTTP status code 301 (Moved Permanently).

Learn more about this API by reviewing the [Benefits Documents API documentation] (https://developer.va.gov/explore/benefits/docs/benefits-documents?version=current).
