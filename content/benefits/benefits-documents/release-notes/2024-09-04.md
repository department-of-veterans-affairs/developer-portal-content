We updated the Benefits Documents API validation endpoints with the following changes:

-  the claimant validation endpoint has changed from /documents/validate to /documents/validate/claimant. The required parameters are now docType, claimID, and either fileNumber or participantID
 -  the documents/search/validate endpoint has been removed
