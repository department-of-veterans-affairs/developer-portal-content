We added 3 new services in support of our v2 Intent to File functionality. This allows consumers to validate their Intent to File submission, submit an Intent to File, as well as retrieve an active Intent to File by benefit type. This release includes the following new endpoints: 

-   /veterans/{veteranId}/intent-to-file
-   /veterans/{veteranId}/intent-to-file/{type}
-   /veterans/{veteranId}/intent-to-file/validate
