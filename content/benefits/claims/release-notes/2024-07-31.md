We updated our v2 GET /veterans/{veteranId}/claims/{id}/5103 endpoint with the following changes:

* added support for dependent claimants submitting 5103 evidence waivers
* removed the optional sponsorIcn query parameter. Now, internal logic locates the correct location for uploading 5103 waivers related to dependent claims.
* added an optional request attribute to associate tracked item ids with 5103 evidence waiver submissions. Including the tracked item id in the request will change the associated item's status to SUBMITTED_AWAITING_REVIEW.
