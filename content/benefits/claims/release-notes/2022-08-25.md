- We updated the validation logic in our `POST /forms/526` endpoint to align with upstream requirements:
  - The `applicationExpirationDate` must be after today's date, if included. By default, the `applicationExpirationDate` will be set to one year from the current date. [These changes were made in PR #10550](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/pull/10550).
  - The `country` on `currentMailingAddress` must align with the values returned by the `"/countries"` endpoint on the [Benefits Reference Data API](https://developer.va.gov/explore/benefits/docs/benefits_reference_data?version=current). [These changes were made in PR #10547](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/pull/10547).
