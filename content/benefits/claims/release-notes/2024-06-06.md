We added an optional request attribute for internal VA consumers to include special issues 'POW' or 'EMP' for disabilities claimed.

This release includes updates to the following v2 endpoints:

* /veterans/{veteranId}/526
* /veterans/{veteranId}/526/validate
* /veterans/{veteranId}/526/generatePDF/minimum-validations
