-- Using Tamara Ellis' previous code of `A1Q` will still work, but attempts to assign `A1Q` to a Veteran test user will not change their POA code.  Using `067` will change their POA code.

-- Using John Doe's previous code of `A1H` will still work, but attempts to assign `A1H` to a Veteran test user will not change their POA code.  Using `072` will change their POA code.
