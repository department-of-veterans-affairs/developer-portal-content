We made updates to the v1 "/forms/526" endpoint to make sure the schemas and descriptions better match the wording on the 526EZ form:

- Several schema descriptions were updated, but their functionality remains unchanged. Updated schema descriptions can be reviewed in the [Benefits Claims API documentation](https://developer.va.gov/explore/benefits/docs/claims?version=current).
- We deprecated 2 schemas because they were duplicating functionality supported by other schemas:
  1.  `servicePay.hasSeparationPay` was deprecated because its functionality is supported by `servicePay.separationPay`.
  2.  `servicePay.militaryRetiredPay.willReceiveInfuture` was deprecated because its functionality is supported by `servicePay.militaryRetiredPay.willReceiveInFuture`. It also fixes letter case inconsistencies.
