We added a new v2 service that allows internal VA users to generate a 526EZ PDF for a disability compensation claim with minimum validations. This service will be limited to internal consumers for the purpose of backup submissions.

This release includes the following new endpoint:

* /veterans/{veteranId}/generatePDF/minimum-validations
