We added support for dependent claimants submitting 5103 evidence waivers.

We removed the optional sponsorIcn query parameter and added internal logic to lookup the Veteran associated to the claim to locate the correct location for uploading 5103 waivers related to dependent claims.

Additionally, we added an optional request attribute to associate tracked item ids to 5103 evidence waiver submissions. By including the tracked item id in the request, the associated tracked item will move to SUBMITTED_AWAITING_REVIEW status.
