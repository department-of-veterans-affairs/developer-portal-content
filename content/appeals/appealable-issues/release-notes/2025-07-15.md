### Introducing the Appealable Issues API!

**Version v0 of the Appealable Issues API is active and available for use.**

The Appealable Issues API lets you retrieve a claimant's previously decided (appealable) issues and any chains of preceding issues. An "issue" is a problem listed in a claim to VA, and a claim may include multiple issues. Claimants may be Veterans or dependents of Veterans, such as spouses, children (biological and step), and parents (biological and foster).

You can use appealable issues data to submit a Higher-Level Review, Notice of Disagreement, or Supplemental Claim. Note that issues returned by the API may be eligible for appeal to VA, but eligibility is not guaranteed. In some cases, an issue may be ineligible because it is already in VA's review process, indicated by the `activeReview` field being (users are discouraged from submitting an issue with an `activeReview` of `true` because this will submit a duplicate Decision Review).

To check the status of all decision reviews or appeals for a specified individual, use the [Appeals Status API](https://developer.va.gov/explore/api/appeals-status).
