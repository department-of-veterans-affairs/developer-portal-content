### Introducing the Legacy Appeals API!

**Version 0 of the Legacy Appeals API is active and available for use.**

The Legacy Appeals API lets you retrieve a claimant's active legacy appeals, which are not part of the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) process. Claimants may be Veterans or dependents of Veterans, such as spouses, children (biological and step), and parents (biological and foster).

You can use legacy appeals data to file a Notice of Disagreement. [Learn more about managing a legacy appeal](https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/legacy-appeals/).

To check the status of all decision reviews or appeals for a specified individual, use the [Appeals Status API](https://www.developer.va.gov/explore/api/appeals-status/docs).

To learn more, review the [Legacy Appeals API v0 documentation](https://developer.va.gov/explore/api/legacy-appeals).
