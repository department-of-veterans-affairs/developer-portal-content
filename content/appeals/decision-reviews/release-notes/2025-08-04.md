The requirement that phone numbers include an `areaCode` value has been removed from all phone numbers across the Higher-Level Reviews, Supplemental Claims, and Notice of Disagreement endpoints of the Decision Reviews API. The purpose of this change is to improve support for international phone numbers. All phone numbers should continue to include an `areaCode` value when applicable.
