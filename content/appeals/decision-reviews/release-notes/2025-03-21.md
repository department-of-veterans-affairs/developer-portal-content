The `activeReview` field has been added to the Contestable Issues endpoints of the Decision Reviews API. This is a boolean field that indicates whether a contestable issue is already part of an active Decision Review that is being processed by VA. The purpose of this field is to indicate to users whether an issue is already in VA's review process, and to reduce the number of duplicate submissions. Users are discouraged from submitting an issue with an `activeReview` of `true` because this will create a duplicate Decision Review.
