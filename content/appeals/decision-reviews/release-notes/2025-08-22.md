The Final Status (final_status) attribute has been added to the following evidence submission endpoints of the Decision Reviews API:

-POST /services/appeals/v2/decision_reviews/notice_of_disagreements/evidence_submissions
-GET /services/appeals/v2/decision_reviews/notice_of_disagreements/evidence_submissions/{uuid}
-POST /services/appeals/v2/decision_reviews/supplemental_claims/evidence_submissions
-GET /services/appeals/v2/decision_reviews/supplemental_claims/evidence_submissions/{uuid} 

This attribute indicates whether the status of a submission is final. It will default to false unless one of the following conditions is met:

- The submission reaches VBMS.
- The submission has reached the success status but will not be uploaded into VBMS.
-The submission expired.
- The submission has errored, with a DOC1XX code.

Submissions with a final_status of true will no longer update to a new status.
