We recently deprecated the higher_level_reviews endpoint for the [Decision Reviews API V1](https://developer.va.gov/explore/appeals/docs/decision_reviews?version=1.0.0).
This endpoint is now removed, and its documentation is no longer available.
Consumers who were using this endpoint may instead use the following 2 new endpoints in the [Decision Reviews API V2](https://developer.va.gov/explore/appeals/docs/decision_reviews?version=current):
 - Higher_level_reviews
 - Legacy_appeals
