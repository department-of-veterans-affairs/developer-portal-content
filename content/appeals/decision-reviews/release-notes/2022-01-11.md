Release Notes for new Contestable Issues standalone endpoint

We added a new endpoint (`GET /contestable_issues/{decision_review_type}`) to the Decision Reviews API. This endpoint returns contestable issues for a specific Veteran. Using this endpoint lets you tailor your appeal submission flow based on the Veteran’s issues. 

This endpoint returns contestable issues for a single Veteran based on the Veteran’s social security number.
You can search for contestable issues based on these appeal types: higher_level_reviews, notice_of_disagreements, and supplemental_claims. 
The endpoint returns only issues that have been decided as of the receiptDate.
