We added the `finalStatus` attribute to the following evidence submission endpoints:

- POST /notice_of_disagreements/evidence_submissions
- GET /notice_of_disagreements/evidence_submissions/{uuid}
- POST /supplemental_claims/evidence_submissions
- GET /supplemental_claims/evidence_submissions/{uuid} 

This attribute shows whether a submission's status is final. It defaults to false unless one of these conditions applies:

- The submission reached the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS)
- The submission reached the success status but will not be uploaded into VBMS
- The submission expired
- The submission returned an error with a DOC1XX code

When `finalStatus` is true, the submission will no longer update to a new status.
