Release of Appeals Status v1.

Appeals Status v1 includes the following changes:

* Introduced API-specific scopes as a replacement for the broader OAuth scopes, for clearer, more granular permission control.
* Updated response code for temporary service outages from 502 (Bad Gateway) to 503 (Service Unavailable) to better reflect service status.
* Updated response code for authorization failures from 400 (Bad Request) to 403 (Forbidden) to more accurately reflect permission issues.
* Improved existing 422 response to clearly indicate missing or invalid parameters.
* Removed the header `X-VA-User`, as it had no functional impact.
* Clarified existing behavior by documenting previously undocumented `404 Not Found` response.
