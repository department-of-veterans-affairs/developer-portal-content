Release of Appeals Status v1

Appeals Status v1 includes the following changes:

* Introduced Oauth support for secure authentication and authorization in the API.
* Updated response code for temporary service outages from 502 (Bad Gateway) to 503 (Service Unavailable) to better reflect service status.
* Updated response code for authorization failures from 400 (Bad Request) to 403 (Forbidden) to more accurately reflect permission issues.
* Improved existing 422 response to clearly indicate missing or invalid parameters.
* Removed the header `X-VA-User`, as it had no functional impact.
* Removed the header `X-VA-SSN`. It was replaced by the `icn` URL param, which is optional when using a veteran-scoped token and required when using a representative- or system-scoped token.
* Clarified existing behavior by documenting previously undocumented `404 Not Found` response.
