Version 0 of the Appeals Status API is deactivated and has been removed from VA Developer.

We deactivated this version after the release of Version 1 of this API. Version 1 changes the authorization model to OAuth 2.0, which makes the API available to the public for the first time.

For more information about the Appeals Status API v1, including about how to request access, please refer to the [API documentation](https://developer.va.gov/explore/api/appeals).
