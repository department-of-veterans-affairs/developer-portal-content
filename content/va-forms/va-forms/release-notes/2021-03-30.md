(v0) We added a new field, last_sha256_change, to the VA Forms API FormsIndex endpoint. This will allow consumers to know when the pdf file last changed.
* Added the last sha256 revision to the FormsIndex endpoint [#6292](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/pull/6292)
  * Example value: "last_sha256_change": "2019-08-01"
