## These APIs allow verification of Veteran status and data. They return service history, confirm Veteran status, and validate address information. 

We’re giving Veterans better control of and access to their information – including their service history, Veteran status, discharge information, and more by working with government agencies and industry partners to help Veterans put their information to work. <Link to="/release-notes/verification">Review the latest release notes</Link>.
