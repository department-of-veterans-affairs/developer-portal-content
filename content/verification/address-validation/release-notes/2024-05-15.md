We released version 3 (v3) of the Address Validation API. Updates include:
- `/validate` and `/candidate` endpoints

     - Removing support for US Congressional District. 
     - Adding country code support for both International Standards Organization (ISO) and Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS). 

- Renaming `/cityStateProvince` endpoint to `/locality` to reflect the capability of the endpoint.

- For ease of mapping, fields are renamed to be identical between this API and Contact Information API version 2 (v2).
