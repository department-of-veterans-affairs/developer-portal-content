We released version 3 (v3) of address validation. Updates include:
- `/validate` and `/candidate` endpoints

     - Removing support for US Congressional District. 
     - Adding country code support for both International Standards Organization (ISO) and Federal Information Processing (FIPS) standards.

- `/cityStateProvince` endpoint is renamed to `/locality` to reflect the capability of the endpoint.

- For ease of mapping,  fields are renamed to be identical between this API and Contact Information API version 2 (v2).
