We released version 3 (v3) of address validation. Updates include:
- `/validate` and `/candidate` endpoints

     - Removing support for US Congressional District. 
     - Added country code support for both International Standards Organization (ISO)  and Federal Information Processing (FIPS) standards.

- `/cityStateProvince` endpoint is renamed to `/locality` to reflect the capability.

- For ease of mapping,  fields are renamed to be identical between this service and contact information service in version 2 of the API.
