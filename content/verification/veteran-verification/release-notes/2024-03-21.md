We've updated the response for /disability ratings. Diagnostic_type_code under individual_ratings will now include all values associated with the disability rating from the VA source system. Our response concatenates values when more than one is provided for a disability rating, inserting a hypen character "-" between each value.

To learn more, review the [Veteran Service History and Eligibility v2 documentation](https://developer.va.gov/explore/api/veteran-service-history-and-eligibility/docs?version=current).
