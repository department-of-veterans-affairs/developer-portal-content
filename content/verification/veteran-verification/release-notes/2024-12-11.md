We have added 2 new public endpoints to disability_rating in the Veteran Service History and Eligibility API.

* GET /public/disability_rating
  
* POST /public/disability_rating
  
The API response schemas for the new endpoints are the same as their non-public versions, (GET /disability_rating and POST /disability_rating) except that they do not return protected health information. This will allow consumers to access Veteran disability information on a need to know basis, while limiting protected health information to authorized consumers.
