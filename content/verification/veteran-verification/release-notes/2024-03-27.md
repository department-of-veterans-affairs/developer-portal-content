We modified the API response for the disability ratings endpoints for v2 of the Veteran Service History and Eligibility API.
* We no longer return disability ratings with an end date in the past.
* A response with no disability rating now contains a blank array in the data fields instead of [Null].

To learn more, review the [Veteran Service History and Eligibility v2 documentation](https://developer.va.gov/explore/api/veteran-service-history-and-eligibility/docs?version=current).
