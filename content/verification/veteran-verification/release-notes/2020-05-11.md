Added combined disability rating and individual disability ratings to the disability_rating endpoint.
- `/disability_rating` endpoint: Adds `combined_disability_rating` field to responses. This is expressed as a percentage and represents how much a Veteranâ€™s disability decreases their overall health and ability to function.
- `/disability_rating` endpoint: Adds `individual_ratings` array to responses with each entry representing whether the individual condition is service related, when the Veteran could begin claiming benefits related to this disability, and the disability rating for the individual condition expressed as a percentage.
