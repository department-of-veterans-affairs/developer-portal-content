We have added an additional endpoint to offer Veteran disability data without disclosing any medical diagnoses for disability ratings.

**Name**: summary/disability_rating

**Description**: Information about a Veteran's VA disability rating, including individual and combined ratings, and eligibility dates for compensation for service-connected conditions.

The new endpoint is now the default for anyone onboarding to request disability rating data.

For more details, [review the API documentation](https://developer.va.gov/explore/api/veteran-service-history-and-eligibility/docs?version=current).
