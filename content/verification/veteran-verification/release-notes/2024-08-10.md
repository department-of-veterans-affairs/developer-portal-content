Modifications were made to the OAS documentation for the Veteran Service History and Eligibility API. For more information, visit the [documentation](https://developer.va.gov/explore/api/veteran-service-history-and-eligibility/docs?version=current). 
*	The list of ACA specific error codes previously listed in the description for the HTTP 200 Successful Response schema were removed (errors are not applicable for HTTP 200 Successful Responses).
*	HTTP 404 error was removed from OAS document as unnecessary (this error code will not be generated for the API). 
* HTTP 422 error was modified in the application to return the error as shown in the OAS documentation (includes “V1000 – Data Error/Invalid Request”). 
* Example pictures were modified to match the OAS schema for the following HTTP errors:  429, 500, 502, and 503.  
* HTTP 413 error was added to the OAS document (not previously included).
