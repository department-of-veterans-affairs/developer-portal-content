Launched the Disability Rating and Veteran Status endpoints
- `/disability_rating`: Given an authenticated user, this created an endpoint that returns a Veteran's disability rating from VA
- `/status`: Allows third-parties to request confirmation from the VA of an individual's Veteran status after receiving authorization to do so using an Open ID Connect flow.
