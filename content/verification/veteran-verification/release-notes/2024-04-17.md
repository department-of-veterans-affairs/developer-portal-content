We added a new endpoint: ACA Coverage (restricted access) for v2 of the Veteran Service History and Eligibility API.
* Authorized users can send requests to this endpoint to check a Veteran's enrollment in minimum essential coverage (MEC) as defined by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). This enrollment request requires a specified date range. 

To learn more, review the [Veteran Service History and Eligibility v2 documentation](https://developer.va.gov/explore/api/veteran-service-history-and-eligibility/docs?version=current).
