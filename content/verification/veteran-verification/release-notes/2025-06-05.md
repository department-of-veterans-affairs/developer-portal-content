## Disability ratings
We have added two new public endpoints to disability_rating for the Veteran Service History and Eligibility API.

 * GET /summary/disability_rating
 * POST /summary/disability_rating

The API response schemas for the new endpoints are the same as their non-summary versions (GET /disability_rating and POST /disability_rating), with the exception of removing protected health information such as diagnostic codes. This will give consumers access to basic summary information (without any diagnostic details) and still allow approved users to see more detailed information if they need it.

For more information, [review the documentation](https://developer.va.gov/explore/api/veteran-service-history-and-eligibility/docs?version=current).

## Flashes
We fixed an issue in the Flashes endpoint that sometimes left out data in the API response.
