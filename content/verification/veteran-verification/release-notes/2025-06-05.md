We added two new endpoints:

 - GET /summary/disability_rating
 - POST /summary/disability_rating

These return the same disability rating information as the existing endpoints, but omit health-related data (diagnostic codes). The response schemas also match the existing endpoints.

We also fixed an issue in the Flashes endpoints that occasionally caused missing data in responses.
