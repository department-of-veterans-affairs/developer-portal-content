We've added some updates to v2 of the Veteran Service History & Eligibility API.
The following disability rating fields have been added:
  - diagnostic_text, which is a description of the diagnosis. An example of this field would be bilateral hearing loss.
  - disability_rating_id, which is the individual rating ID of a disability. 





Review the API documentation to learn more about the new version of this API.
