We've added some updates to v2 of the Veteran Service History & Eligibility API.
The following disability rating fields have been added:
  - diagnostic_text, which is a description of the diagnosis. An example of this field would be bilateral hearing loss.
  -disability_rating_id

As always, it's important to know that the new version must support backward compatibility. It should:

Be prepared to handle HTTP status codes not explicitly specified in endpoint definitions.

Be tolerant of unknown fields in the payload and ignore the deserialization of new fields.

Follow the redirect when the server returns an HTTP status code 301 (Moved Permanently).

Review the API documentation to learn more about the new version of this API.
