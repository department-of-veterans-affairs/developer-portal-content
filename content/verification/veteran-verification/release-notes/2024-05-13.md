We updated the results returned for disability ratings. They will now exclude ratings that do not have a “begin” date.

- We added a second (optional) diagnostic type code field in the response section for individual ratings attributes. The field name is hyph_diagnostic_type_code.
If we receive the optional code from the disability rating source system, it will be included in the API response (directly after diagnostic_type_code).
Additionally, a field labeled static indicator is now included in the API response for disability ratings. The values in this field are (Y)es or (N)o.
