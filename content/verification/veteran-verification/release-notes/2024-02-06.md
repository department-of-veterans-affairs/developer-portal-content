An update was made to the disability rating endpoint to utilize a modernized service for the source data.

* Only active rated disabilities are returned from /disability rating endpoint.  For example, pending claims are not included as they lack a rating value and therefore are not part of the Veteranâ€™s current (active) disability rating profile. 
* The request format and response returned by the API have not changed.
* The VSHE /disability rating endpoint url that consumers use does not change.
* Client credentials and authorizations do not change.
