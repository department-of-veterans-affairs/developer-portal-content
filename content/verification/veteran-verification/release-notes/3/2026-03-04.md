We've added these new endpoints for a Veteran’s permanent and total (P&T) disability status and total disability based on Individual Unemployability (IU) status:

* GET /permanent_and_total_disability
* POST /permanent_and_total_disability 
* POST /restricted/permanent_and_total_disability

These endpoints provide a consolidated disability status to help determine eligibility for benefits and services. They return:

* P&T disability designation
* IU disability status
* Effective date for total disability determination
