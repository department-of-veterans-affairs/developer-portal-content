 We have added two new public endpoints to disability_rating in the Veteran Service History and Eligibility API.
 
 * GET /summary/disability_rating
   
 * POST /summary/disability_rating
   
 The API response schemas for the new endpoints are the same as their non-summary versions (GET /disability_rating and POST /disability_rating), with the exception of removing protected health information such as diagnostic codes. This will allow access to summary information for consumers in general (no diagnostic details), and also continue to support approved consumers with need to know.
