We've added two restricted access endpoints that allow government agencies to search for Veterans using social security numbers (SSNs), enhancing accessibility while ensuring data privacy.
* The endpoints replicate /status and /disability rating functionalities with the addition of using SSN to search.
* Documentation was updated to reflect these additions and their restricted access.
