We have added 2 new public endpoints to disability_rating in the Veteran Service History and Eligibility API.

* GET /summary/disability_rating
  
* POST /summary/disability_rating
  
The API response schemas for the new endpoints are the same as their non-summary versions (GET /disability_rating and POST /disability_rating), except protected health information such as diagnostic codes is not returned in the API response. This will allow access to summary information to consumers in general (no diagnostic details), while continuing support for authorized consumers with need to know.
