We changed validation for the street address fields to accept the "#" symbol. This applies to all endpoints that accept Veteran demographic data.
In the documentation, these fields are labeled:

- streetAddressLine1
- streetAddressLine2
- streetAddressLine3

For more details, please refer to the [API documentation.](https://developer.va.gov/explore/api/veteran-confirmation/docs?version=current)
