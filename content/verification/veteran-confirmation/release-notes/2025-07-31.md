We have updated our OAS documentation to improve clarity and ensure expected behavior is easier to understand. 

- "Numbers" has been removed from the list of allowed characters for Name field.
- First character must be an alpha or letter character (upper or lowercase).
- Consecutive special characters are not supported. (i.e, forward slash /,   back slash \,    hyphen -,   single quote/apostrophe  ' )
- Diacritical characters—letters with added marks such as accents (é) or umlauts (ä) that change pronunciation or meaning—are not currently supported and will generate an error.
