We have updated our OAS documentation to clarify expected input formats. These improvements will reduce unexpected errors by ensuring input expectations are clear. 

- "Numbers" has been removed from the list of allowed characters for Name field.
- First character must be an alpha or letter character (upper or lowercase).
- Consecutive special characters are not supported (such as '/,' or '\\\'). Special characters include: forward slash (/), back slash (\\), hyphen (-), single quote/apostrophe (').
- Diacritical characters—which are characters with added marks such as accents (é) or umlauts (ä)—are not currently supported and will generate an error.
