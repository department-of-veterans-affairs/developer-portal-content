We have updated our OAS documentation to improve clarity and ensure expected behavior is easier to understand. 

- "Numbers" has been removed from list of allowed characters for Name field
- First character must be an alpha/letter character (upper or lowercase)
- Consecutive special characters are not supported. (i.e, forward slash /,   back slash \,    hyphen -,   single quote/apostrophe  ' )
- Diacritical characters (i.e.,  ä: umlaught; é: accent) are not currently supported and will generate an error.
