There is a new version (v1) of the Veteran Confirmation API.
We've added new functionality to the status endpoint in version 1. New functionality includes:
- `/status`: Added 'ID' field and 'Not Confirmed' reason to the request confirmation (200) response. 
- `/status`: Removed the Veteran's SSN and added the Veteranâ€™s address (street, city, zip code, state, country) to the request body. 
- `/status`: Increased quantity of error handling. 
- `/status`: Added address validation.
