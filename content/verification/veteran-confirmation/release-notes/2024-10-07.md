Version v0 of the Veteran Confirmation API is deprecated.

When we deprecate a version of an API, it will still be supported, but its use is discouraged. Deactivation has been extended to January 30, 2025. We’ll honor service-level agreements, but no new features will be added to the API version and only critical defects will be considered for correction.

We’ve deprecated this API version because a new version (V1) of Veteran Confirmation API is available.
We've added new functionality to the status endpoint in version 1. New functionality includes:
- `/status`: Added 'ID' field and 'Not Confirmed' reason to the request confirmation (200) response. [View code change(s)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/lighthouse-veteran-confirmation/pull/72).
- `/status`: Removed the Veteran's SSN and added the Veteran’s address (street, city, zip code, state, country) to the request body. [View code change(s)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/lighthouse-veteran-confirmation/pull/14).
- `/status`: Increased quantity of error handling. [View code change(s)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/lighthouse-veteran-confirmation/pull/62).
- `/status`: Added address validation. [View code change(s)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/lighthouse-veteran-confirmation/pull/68).
