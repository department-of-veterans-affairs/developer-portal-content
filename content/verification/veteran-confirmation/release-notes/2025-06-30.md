Version 0 of the Veteran Confirmation API is deactivated and has been removed from VA Developer. 

We deactivated this verson of the API to support the VA effort to minimize use of Social Security Numbers (SSN).   

Veteran Confirmation Version 1 is now the active API, with Veterans identified in the API request with their demographic data (such as street address, city, state, zip).

For more information about demoographic data for the API request, please refer to the [API documentation. ](https://developer.va.gov/explore/api/veteran-confirmation/docs)
