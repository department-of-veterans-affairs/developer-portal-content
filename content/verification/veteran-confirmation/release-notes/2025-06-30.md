Version 0 of the Veteran Confirmation API is deactivated and has been removed from VA Developer. 

We deactivated this version of the API to support VA's effort to minimize the use of Social Security Numbers (SSNs).   

Version 1 of the Veteran Confirmation API is now the active. With this API, Veterans are now identified in the API request with their demographic data (such as their street address, city, state, and ZIP).

For more information about Veteran demographic data with the API request, please refer to the [API documentation](https://developer.va.gov/explore/api/veteran-confirmation/docs).
