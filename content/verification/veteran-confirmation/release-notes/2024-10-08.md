Version v0 of the Veteran Confirmation API is deprecated.

When we deprecate a version of an API, it will still be supported, but its use is discouraged. We’ll honor service-level agreements, but no new features will be added to the API version and only critical defects will be considered for correction. Deactivation of version v0 of the Veteran Confirmation API will happen on **January 30, 2025**.

We’ve deprecated this API version because a new version (v1) of Veteran Confirmation API is available.

Version one has new functionality to the status endpoint. The new functionality includes:
- `/status`: Added 'ID' field and 'Not Confirmed' reason to the request confirmation (200) response.
- `/status`: Removed the Veteran's SSN and added the Veteran’s address (street, city, zip code, state, country) to the request body.
- `/status`: Increased quantity of error handling. 
- `/status`: Added address validation.
