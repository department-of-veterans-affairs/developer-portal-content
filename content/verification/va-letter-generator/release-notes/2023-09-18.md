We've added a new ID field, SponsorID, to the VA Letter Generator API. SponsorID is conditionally required if the original ICN is for a dependent. The SponsorID is the ICN of the Veteran affiliated with the dependent.

With the new SponsorID field, the VA Letter Generator API supports two use cases:
1) Veteran 
2) Dependent of a Veteran. 
This context is determined by the ID field in the API request.  If the ID is for a Dependent, in order to correctly generate a Benefit Summary Dependent Letter the Sponsor_ID is required to retrieve the sponsoring Veteranâ€™s information necessary for the Dependent letter.   

If a request is made to the API for a Dependent ID without a Sponsor_ID  the Benefit Summary Dependent letter will not be available. 

Note:  Veterans are not provided the Dependent letter; only a Dependent has the option to generate a Benefit Summary Dependent Letter.
