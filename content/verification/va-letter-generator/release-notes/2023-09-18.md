We've added a new ID field, SponsorID, to the VA Letter Generator API. SponsorID is conditionally required if the original ICN is for a dependent. The SponsorID is the ICN of the Veteran affiliated with the dependent.

With the new SponsorID field, the VA Letter Generator API supports two use cases:
1) A Veteran generating and downloading letters
2) A Veteran's dependent downloading and generating letters
In order for the API to generate letters for a dependent, a sponsoring Veteran's ICN must be in the SponsorID field. If a dependent's ICN is used without a SponsorID, letters will not be available to the dependent.

If a request is made to the API for a Dependent ID without a Sponsor_ID  the Benefit Summary Dependent letter will not be available. 

Note:  Veterans are not provided the Dependent letter; only a Dependent has the option to generate a Benefit Summary Dependent Letter.
