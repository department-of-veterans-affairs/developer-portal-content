We've added a new ID field, SponsorID, to the VA Letter Generator API. SponsorID is conditionally required if the original ICN is for a dependent. The SponsorID is the ICN of the Veteran affiliated with the dependent.

With the new SponsorID field, the VA Letter Generator API supports two use cases:
1) A Veteran generating and downloading letters
2) A Veteran's dependent downloading and generating letters
In order for the API to generate letters for a dependent, a sponsoring Veteran's ICN must be in the SponsorID field. If a dependent's ICN is used without a SponsorID, letters will not be available to the dependent.


**Note:** Veterans will never be able to generate a dependent's benefit summary letter. Only a dependent can do that.
