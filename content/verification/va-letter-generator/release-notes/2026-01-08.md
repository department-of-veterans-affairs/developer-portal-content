We added the Foreign Medical Program (FMP) letter. It allows Veterans abroad to download a letter with their service-connected disabilities and foreign address. It’s available for Veterans who: 
- Are confirmed as Title 38-eligible 
- Have a combined service-connected disability percentage of 0 or greater
