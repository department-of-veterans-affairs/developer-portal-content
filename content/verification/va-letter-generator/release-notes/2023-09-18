A new ID field was added to the API that is conditionally required.  The field name is Sponsor_ID, the Veteran ID for a Dependent.    

The VA Letter Generator API supports two contexts of use:  
1) Veteran 
2) Dependent of a Veteran. 
This context is determined by the ID field in the API request.  If the ID is for a Dependent, in order to correctly generate a Benefit Summary Dependent Letter the Sponsor_ID is required to retrieve the sponsoring Veteranâ€™s information necessary for the Dependent letter.   

If a request is made to the API for a Dependent ID without a Sponsor_ID  the Benefit Summary Dependent letter will not be available. 

Note:  Veterans are not provided the Dependent letter; only a Dependent has the option to generate a Benefit Summary Dependent Letter.
