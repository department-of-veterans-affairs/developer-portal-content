We removed the Sponsor ID field from the VA Letter Generator API. We will now verify whether the API request ID is a Veteran or dependent by checking VA source records. When a dependent of a Veteran generates a letter, the correct data for the dependent and/or Veteran is populated in that letter.

Read more about the change in the [API documentation](https://developer.va.gov/explore/api/va-letter-generator/docs?version=current).
