 - The VBA letterhead and logo has been restored to all letters except the Minimum Essential Coverage and Medicare Park D (which keep the VHA letterhead and logo). 
 - We fixed a defect that caused a benefit award amount to mistakenly display $0 instead of the actual amount. 
 - We corrected the Veteran Benefit Summary letter to include a 0% disability rating as a service-connected disability (example: service-connected disabilities = Y).
