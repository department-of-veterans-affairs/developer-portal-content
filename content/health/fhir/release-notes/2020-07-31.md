We are decreasing the data hold time for the Veterans Health API from 72 hours to 36 hours, effective July 31, 2020, based on an updated VHA policy.  When a physician enters or changes patient data, there is a holding period before the data is released and visible through other applications such as health apps. The holding period gives physicians time to contact their patients and discuss health data, such as sensitive diagnoses, before the patient sees this data elsewhere. This change applies only to real data entered into the production environment.
