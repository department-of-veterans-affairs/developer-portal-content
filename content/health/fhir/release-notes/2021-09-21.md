We added new elements and values to the R4 `Condition` FHIR mapping. 
-  The `clinicalStatus` element now supports the value `inactive`.
-  The `verificationStatus` element now returns these additional values:`provisional`, `differential`, `confirmed`, and `refuted`. Previously, this element always returned  `unconfirmed`.
-  The `recorder` element is now added.

The R4 `AllergyIntolerance` FHIR mapping now includes both `clincalStatus` and `verificationStatus`.  Previously, only one was populated based on value. 

The `primarySource` for the R4 `Immunization` FHIR mapping now supports Boolean values. Previously, it was always `true`.
