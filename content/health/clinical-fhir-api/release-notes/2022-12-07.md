We have added two new parameters to the MedicationRequest resource.
 - The identifier parameter represents the Order ID as recorded in the VistA EHR system, is returned in all MedicationRequest entries, and is searchable.
 - The -health-care-system parameter can narrow the search to the specified health care system within the VA.

For more detail about these new identifiers and their usage, see the Parameters section of our [Clinical Health API (FHIR) documentation](https://developer.va.gov/explore/health/docs/clinical_health?version=current).
