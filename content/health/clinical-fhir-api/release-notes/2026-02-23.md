Version 1 of the Clinical Health API is now available in the **sandbox environment** for testing and integration.

**What's new?**

Authorization Provider:
* The API now uses Microsoft Entra ID for authorization, replacing the previous single sign-on internal (SSOi) system
* JSON web tokens (JWTs) are issued without an introspection endpoint

Token Behavior and Policy:
* Access tokens now expire between 60-90 minutes for enhanced security
* Access token lifetime is variable by design
* Refresh tokens expire 10 hours after issuance, regardless of usage

The target release date for v1 in the **production environment** is March 2, 2026.
