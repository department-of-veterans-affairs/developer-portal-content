We've updated the race and ethnicity URLs in R4 Patient resource records to comply with the new U.S. Core 5 standards for race and new U.S. Core 5 standards for ethnicity.

In addition, we fixed an inconsistency in the R4 MedicationRequest resource by updating it to return only the self link in an empty bundle. The first/last links will no longer be populated.
