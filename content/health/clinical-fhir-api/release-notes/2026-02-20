Version 1 of the Clinical Health API is now available in Sandbox for testing and integration. Production release target date is **March 2, 2026**.

**Key Updates**:

Authorization Provider Change:
* The API now uses Microsoft Entra ID for internal authorization.
* Entra ID replaces IAM SSOi as the authorization provider.
* JWT tokens are issued without an introspection endpoint.

Access Token Behavior:
* Token lifespan is randomized between 60–90 minutes for enhanced security.
* Access token lifetime is variable by design.

Refresh Token Policy:
* Refresh tokens expire 10 hours after issuance, regardless of usage.
* This applies to both Sandbox and Production environments.
