The CCE API now presents and accounts for a veteran's PACT status (Patient Aligned Care Team) when calculating eligibility.
- PACT status is only consulted for PrimaryCare requests. A veteran with an active PACT is ineligible for community care for Primary Care appointments.  
- The new field 'pactStatus' has been added to the API response when it has been used in the eligibility determination.
