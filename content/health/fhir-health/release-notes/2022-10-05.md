We have added two new R4 FHIR resources, which support Clinical Notes: 
-  R4 DocumentReference:  Provides metadata about the document along with a reference to the R4 Binary resource.  Implementation of this resource conforms to the [US Core DocumentReference Profile](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/US-Core/StructureDefinition-us-core-documentreference.html).
-  R4 Binary: Provides the content of a document in base64 Binary format in accordance with the FHIR specification.  Plain text is the only MIME format supported.

For related test data, see our [Health Test Patient Data spreadsheet](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/health-apis-datamart-synthetic-records/blob/qa/health-test-patient-data.xlsx) where the Resource is marked as DocumentReference.
