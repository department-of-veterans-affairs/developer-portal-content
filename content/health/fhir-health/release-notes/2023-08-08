We've made a change to the [Patient Health API](https://developer.va.gov/explore/api/patient-health/docs?version=current) R4 GET /Condition endpoint to allow searching by patient and recorded date. This change supports an optional search functionality for U.S. Core 5. The [U.S. Core 5 standards](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/ImplementationGuide/hl7.fhir.us.core) are based on FHIR Version R4 and define the essential requirements for FHIR resources to create the US Core Profiles.
