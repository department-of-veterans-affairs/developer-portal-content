Added an `identifier` to the `Organization` resource to represent the VA Facility to be consistent with the Facility ID used by the Facilities API. For example a VAMC has an identifier of the form `vha_[stationNumber]` like `vha_673`.

Added an `identifier` to the `Location` resource to represent the VA clinic. This `identifier` has the form `vha_[stationNumber]_[clinic identifier]`.
