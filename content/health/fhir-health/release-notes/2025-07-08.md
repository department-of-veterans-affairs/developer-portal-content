The system used to populate the Encounter.hospitalization.dischargeDisposition.coding.system field has been updated from 'http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/discharge-disposition' to 'http://va.gov/terminology/vistaDefinedTerms/45.6'. This change was made because the previous code system did not include all discharge disposition codes used by the VA. The new system includes those existing codes and additional ones to improve accuracy. This change may impact your application if you rely on the .system field to interpret discharge disposition codes.
