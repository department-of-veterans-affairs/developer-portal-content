The system used to populate the Encounter.hospitalization.dischargeDisposition.coding.system field has been updated from 'http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/discharge-disposition' to 'http://va.gov/terminology/vistaDefinedTerms/45.6'. 

This update ensures all VA-specific discharge disposition codes are supported. The previous system was missing some codes. If your application relies on the .system field to interpret discharge disposition codes, this change may affect functionality.
