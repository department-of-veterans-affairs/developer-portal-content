We have made the following changes: 

* Support for contained resources has been added. We now include related data directly within a resource instead of requiring you to make separate API calls. Make sure your application supports contained resources to use this feature correctly.
* The `identifier.type.coding.code` for Patient and Practitioner resources have been updated from "MR" (Medical Record) to "PN" (Person Number) for the ICN (Integration Control Number) identifier. The ICN is a VA unique identifier for individuals, so this change ensures clarity that this number identifies a person rather than a medical record.
* The `.display` field has been removed from `DocumentReference.type` because the value was not always the correct display for the associated code. The `.text` field should be used for the document type description.
