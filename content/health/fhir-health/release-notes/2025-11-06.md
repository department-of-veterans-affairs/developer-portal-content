The `identifier.type.coding.code` for Patient and Practitioner resources have been updated from "MR" (Medical Record) to "PN" (Person Number) for the ICN (Integration Control Number) identifier. The ICN is a VA unique identifier for individuals, so this change ensures clarity that this number identifies a person rather than a medical record.
