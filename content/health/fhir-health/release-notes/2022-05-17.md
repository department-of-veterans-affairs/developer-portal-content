To better meet the FHIR specification for the Veterans and Clinical Health APIs, we've made some changes to the Organization.type properties for DSTU2 and R4.
 - We will now return the type property for only insurance companies, government agencies, and VA facilities.
 - We are now using [FHIR-standard Organization type codes](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/codesystem-organization-type.html) in the organization.type field to communicate the government and insurance organization types.
 - There are no changes to how the organization type is returned for VA facilities.
