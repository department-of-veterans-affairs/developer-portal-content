We’ve updated the way consumers using authorization code grant access sandbox environment test account credentials for Patient Health API. 

**What’s changed**
- Test account credentials, such as test usernames, passwords, and login information for ID.me and Login.gov, have been removed from the test accounts GitHub pages and placed on a new private page on developer.va.gov.
- In addition, test account credentials for ID.me have been updated. The previous ID.me credentials will expire in 90 days.

**What has not changed**
- The login process for ID.me and Login.gov
- Accessing test data for APIs with the client credentials grant
- The list of test accounts

**What you need to do**
If you already signed up for sandbox access, you should have received an email with a link to the page of test account credentials. Further instructions will be provided in that email.
If you have not yet signed up for sandbox access, you will receive a link to the test account credentials when you sign up.
