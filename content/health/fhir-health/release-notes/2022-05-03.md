We added a new FHIR R4 resource to the [Veterans Health API (FHIR)](https://developer.va.gov/explore/health/docs/fhir?version=current), [DeviceRequest](http://www.hl7.org/Fhir/devicerequest.html), which supports READ and SEARCH functionality. This resource includes only CPAP and BiPAP data.

We also enabled the FHIR _sort parameter for the R4 'Observation', 'Encounter', and 'Appointment' resources. The _sort parameter lets you specify the arrangement of responses in ascending or descending order by certain other parameters. 
 - 'Observation' can be sorted by category, code, date, and _lastUpdated.
 - 'Encounter' can be sorted by date and _lastUpdated.
 - 'Appointment' can be sorted by date and _lastUpdated.
