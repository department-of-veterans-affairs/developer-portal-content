To conform to FHIR specifications, we have added additional snake_case fields to our .well-known response. These provide the same information as their respective camelCase counterparts. We recommend that consumers migrate to using snake_case fields as it is likely that camelCase fields will be removed in a later revision. Should this occur, we will notify consumers ahead of time about the change.
