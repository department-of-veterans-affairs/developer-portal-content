Added the `code` data to the R4 `AllergyIntolerance` resource to be compliant with [US Core Implementation Guide](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition-us-core-allergyintolerance.html).

Updated the `Condition` resource to include [SNOMED CT](http://snomed.info/sct) and ICD-10-CM codings when both are available.
