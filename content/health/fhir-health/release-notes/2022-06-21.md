The Veteran's Health API (FHIR) has been renamed to the Patient Health API (FHIR). We've also updated the layout of this API's documentation, which replaces the FHIR specification tabs with a dropdown. These changes will help our consumers more easily identify the use cases of this and our other health APIs. 

There are no other changes to functionality, requests/responses, or data.

We have also enabled an additional FHIR _sort parameter for the R4 AllergyIntolerance and DiagnosticReport resources. The _sort parameter lets you specify the arrangement of responses in ascending or descending order by certain other parameters.
 - 'AllergyIntolerance' can now be sorted by _lastUpdated.
 - 'DiagnosticReport' can now be sorted by _lastUpdated.
