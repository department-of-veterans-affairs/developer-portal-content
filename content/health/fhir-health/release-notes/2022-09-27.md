We have added two new R4 FHIR resources, which support Clinical Notes: 
-  R4 DocumentReference:  Provides metadata about the document along with a reference to the R4 Binary resource.  Implementation of this resource conforms to the [US Core DocumentReference Profile](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/US-Core/StructureDefinition-us-core-documentreference.html).
-  R4 Binary: Provides the content of a document.  Plain text is the only MIME format supported.
