We've made a change to the Patient Health API R4 GET/DocumentReference endpoint to allow querying DocumentReference by patient + type + period. This change supports an optional search functionality for U.S. Core 5. The [U.S. Core 5 standards](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6.1/ImplementationGuide-hl7.fhir.us.core.html) are based on FHIR Version R4 and define the essential requirements for FHIR resources to create the US Core Profiles.
