We have made backend changes in order to optimize performance, promote stability, and reduce maintenance efforts around the AllergyIntolerance and Procedure resources. As a result, AllergyIntolerance and Procedure identifiers have changed. All cross-resource references are still valid. Old identifiers will be honored for read operations. This change impacts both R4 and DSTU2 resources.
