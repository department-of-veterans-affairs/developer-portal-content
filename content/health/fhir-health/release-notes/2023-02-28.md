The test data for the Patient Health API has been updated to provide a more robust data set for each patient. This broader range of data will allow you to use the same patient to test more resources.

You can review the updated test data by visiting the [Department of Veterans Affairs GitHub test data repository](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api-clients/blob/master/test_accounts/health_test_accounts.md).

Additional information regarding this change can be found in the communications sent to the consumer community on January 30, 2023 and February 21, 2023.
