Decision Reviews API version 2 Release Notes

Version 2 of the Decision Reviews API is now released with the following changes:

We've added a new key, `informalConferenceContact` (required when an informal conference is requested), which will allow us to support both Veteran and representative contacts for informal conferences.
We've updated the possible responses enum of `informalConferenceTime` to reflect the above  changes.
`socOptIn` is now required.
For the representative name, we've split `name` into `firstName` and `lastName` to be more flexible and allow more accurate entries.
The Veteran email field `emailAddressText` has been changed to `email`.

Added hlrCreateAddress to now accept an address for this API. This change follows NOD format:
-`addressLine1`
-`addressLine2`
-`addressLine3`
-`city`
-`stateCode` - enum of all 2-character state codes (see the documentation for more info)
-`countryCodeISO2`
-`zipCode5`
