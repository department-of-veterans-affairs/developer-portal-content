We've added a restricted access endpoint for approved federal consumers to retrieve summary disability rating data with Veteran Social Security Number.
The new endpoint name is restricted/summary/disability_rating.
 - Restricted_ indicates that access to the endpoint is limited to approved Federal Government consumers; and
 - summary/disability rating excludes any personal health information such as a medical diagnosis code or diagnosis description.
